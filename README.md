## <a name="introduction"></a>Introduction
*Next stop explora* features a physical console that relies on **buttons** and **magnetic sensors** for users inputs and **displays and led strips as output**. The buttons and the sensors on the console are associated to typical actions to be performed as a train driver and influences what happens in the display and the leds behaviour.
The displays feature both video (pre-rendered or a camera output) and images.

### Project purpose
*Next stop explora* is designed to be an installation. A full size train cockpit features a display and a basic console.
 
**Two versions** of the installation have been presented: 
- The first one was displaying a video recorded in real time by a camera placed on topo of small toy train controlled through a reley and activated during “Running” state. The train rails were installed above the installation
area, being visible from all the visitors.
- The second relied on a pre rendered video paused and played accordingly with application states.
